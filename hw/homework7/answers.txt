Homework 2

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

('GC-content:', 0.3)

Problem 3:

File "dna_analysis.py", line 38, in <module>
    linenum = linenum + 1
NameError: name 'linenum' is not defined

The program generates a name error because it calls on a variable that wasn't
declared.  The line that originally declared it was blocked out via comments.

Problem 4:

('GC-content:', 0.3)
('AT-content:', 0.7)

Problem 5:

('A-content:', 0.5)
('T-content:', 0.2)
('G-content:', 0.1)
('C-content:', 0.2)

Problem 6:

"test-high-gc-1.fastq" has an error.  Sequence length = 40,000, but base total
is 39840.  Since the difference is small, I declared a string called "error
string" and converted the for loop to an "if, elif, else."  In the event that
bp is not ATGH, the value of the bp will be added to the error string.  This
resulted in "Error String: NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN"

len(seq) and total_count should always be the same, since total_count adds 1 for
every character in seq.  The only unknown is the bp total, which only increases
if the letter matches GCAT.  The correct denominator depends on whether you wish
to know the percentage out of confirmed nucleotides, or if you want the
recipient to know which percent of nucleotides scanned as errors.

Problem 7:

AT/GG: 2.3333333333333335

Problem 8:

moderate gc

Collaboration:

Did not recieve help.

Reflection:

Asignment seemed pretty staight forward.
